- description: 'Customer requires density uncertainty of 0.04 g/cm^3 (k=2) for a gage
    ball of mass 86.03 g and diameter 22.225 mm.


    Find a calibration provider which can meet the density uncertainty requirement.
    Use a reverse-sweep. Anything provider that falls under the curve is acceptable.
