  Resistor R1 in series with two parallel capacitors C2 and C3.


  Resistance type A was loaded from 10 measurements in resistance.txt file using data
  importer.


  Capacitors are given as C2 = 0.1uf +/- .005uf and C3 = .22uf +/- .01uF. Multimeter
  given with uncertainty +/- (.01% of reading + .001% of range) at 95% confidence,
  with range of 100 kohm.


  Be careful of units. With capacitance in microfarads and resistance in kilohms as
  entered, output will be in milliseconds.'
